A quick game framework to play with ruby and c. It was also my project wich make me an engineer

## What is this?
Whell I decided to make my own framework in ruby, because I love the language, and this monstrocity was born.
While not the most polish program made, it has all the documentation (in spanish, sorry guys) on how I made it step-by-step.

## How do you compile it?

You will need visual studio 2010 at least on how I buiuld it

## License
Please see license.md for a more clear list

What do I need to compile:

A compiled version of ruby2
Glew
Wx windows for the editor
Audiere libraries
Freetype

Put all the .lib inside a folder called "lib" and there you go.

At the moment sources or libraries for those bindings are not provided, If someone is willing to help me, please I'll be glad to clean this mess.

At the moment, only works on windows... sorry

You will need visual studio 2010, sorry again... My compilation steps were rushed... and out of my scope...
