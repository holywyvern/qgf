# qgf
A quick game framework to play with ruby and c. It was also my project wich make me an engineer

## What is this?
Whell I decided to make my own framework in ruby, because I love the language, and this monstrocity was born.
While not the most polish program made, it has all the documentation (in spanish, sorry guys) on how I made it step-by-step.

## How do you compile it?

You will need visual studio 2010 at least on how I buiuld it
